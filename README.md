# Samsung_Health_analysis
<b>Data cleaning and analysis project written in Python (Jupyter notebook, Markdown format)</b>

_Summary_: In this Jupyter Notebook, I explain how I extracted 6 years of pedometer data from my Samsung Health app. I also demonstrate how I cleaned the data (removal of duplicates and irrelevant columns) and analyzed them thanks to data visualization. In the case study, I answered the following questions : 

* How many kilometers did I walk over the last 6 years ? (spoiler alert: Far more than I had imagined!)
* How did my walking habits changed over time, and what does explain the ups and downs ?
* Could I achieve frequently the 10,000 steps a day recommendation?

_Technical learnings_: I made this project to allow me coding in Python, a programming language that is very new to me (I am coding only in SQL and R at work). This was also an amazing opportunity for trying Markdown format. Finally, this project was very interesting from a data analysis point of view since the data were quite messy and hard to understand. The removal of duplicates was crucial: keeping them would have made me overestimate my step counts by about 20% (!).
